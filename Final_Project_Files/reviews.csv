"April 13, 2024",Mi crema favorita,It's the best cream I've had in years!
"April 11, 2024",My Go To!,"This is my go to daily morning moisturizer! It absorbs fully, moisturizers and helps with any irritation I get from retinols. I typically use the one with UV but decided to try this one with a separate tinted sunscreen. This is a great product at a great price point!"
"April 10, 2024",Great,My daughter uses the cream day and night and she likes it is not greasy ( she is 16 years old )
"April 06, 2024",very hydrating,I use this mixed with a small amount of rosehip oil over stronger skincare treatments at night (like retinal or glycolic acid.). I really like the moisture it adds to my skin and the price point since I am using it over pricier products.
"April 06, 2024",Irritation,"I started using this moisturizer and another skin care product at the same time and developed some red irritation in spots on my face. Because I don't know which was causing this, I discontinued both until the irritation clears, then will introduce one at a time to see which might be responsible."
"March 29, 2024",Great moisturizer,"My skin is combo, and I love how much it moisturizes without feeling greasy. It’s lightweight but also the perfect amount of heaviness."
"March 28, 2024",Perfect moisturizer,Always have this moisturizer in my cabinet. Perfect for everyday use.
"March 26, 2024",My go to moisturizer,I love this moisturizer even with my really sensitive skin. The niacinamide does not irritate my skin at all. I use this gentle moisturizer every morning and have had no issues with it so far.
"March 22, 2024",A Little Goes a Long Way,I added just a pea size of this moisturizer over my serum at night and my skin is very happy this morning. Excellent moisturizer! This bottle should last a long time!
"March 19, 2024",Great cream,I like the texture of this product. It makes my skin feel velvety and soft.
"March 14, 2024",Dries out my face,"Unfortunately, this moisturizer doesn't moisturize my face enough."
"March 09, 2024",Love!,Very inexpensive and great for my sensitive skin!
"March 08, 2024",Another Roche-Posay Favorite,"This is my morning moisturizer on days when I don't go outside and need sun protection. It goes on smoothly without being greasy or sticky and has no unpleasant odor. I love that it contains ceramide-3 and niacinamide in one product, two ingredients that are part of my skin care routine."
"March 04, 2024",I love the way this feels on my face!,A coworker originally got me using the LaRoche-Posay face wash. Since I liked it so much I decided to try the moisturizer as well. I have now officially switched from my former day moisturizer to this. Feels soft and creamy on the skin but not sticky. Very happy with it!
"March 01, 2024",Excellent product,I've been using this moisturizer for years. It's excellent for sensitive skin. It works well in winter when my skin gets really dry and works equally well in summer when there's more moisture in the air. The Double Repair Face Moisturizer feels light and doesn't cause any irritation on my skin. I've been using La Roche-Posay products for years and this one is my favorite.
"March 01, 2024",Hydrating cream,"While I think this formula is great & hydrating, I don’t find it to be strong enough for NY winters. I have my heater & find that I need to reapply throughout the day"
"February 28, 2024",Great moisturizer for the price,"If you are looking for an affordable daily moisturizer that does not have any UV protection ingredients, this is a great option. I recommend it."
"February 26, 2024",Fantastic Moisturizer,"This has been a great moisturizer to use to keep my face and neck hydrated during the winter months. The texture is soft, oil free and easily absorbed into my skin. I would definitely recommend this product."
"February 25, 2024",Perfect for my ultra-sensitive skin,"I find myself allergic to so many things, in particular fragrances. This works great for me. No reaction, redness, itching or burning."
"February 24, 2024",Dreamy moisture!,"I love this moisturizer! It’s a gel cream texture that feels amazing on the skin. I wanted more moisture while still being oil free and non comedogenic. I use the Toleriane oil free fluid during the day & this is perfect at night. I’m in my 50’s, normal to oily skin type and very sensitive. Get it, you will love!"
"February 20, 2024","Great hydration, use daily","Works great, feels lightweight. Keeps the skin nice and plump looking but you have to use it daily for best results. If you stop using it for a long time for any reason (for example when I run out of it) skin goes back to starting point."
"February 20, 2024",Made my Face Look Greasy,This is a thicker product and left my face looking shiny and greasy. It did not absorb well into my skin and a was a bit disappointing. I will stick with my Replenix products as they do a great job at a great price point when they go on sale.
"February 18, 2024",Good hydration!,Works well with acne-prone skin. Light weight and skin doesn't get sticky.
"February 18, 2024",Clean,Love all their products. My face feels clean and looks healthy. I will buy again.
"February 11, 2024","Decent, basic moisturizer","This is a good day time moisturizer. Wouldn’t be enough for me at night but good for my son who is struggling with breakouts. Also, good price point."
"February 10, 2024",La roche posay toleraine,It keeps my face moisturized all day . I prefer tube packaging than jars since less chance for contamination and easier when travelling. It has the right consistency as well- not too light or too heavy
"February 09, 2024",Smooths skin but a little irritating,"I’ve been using it just over a week and every time I use it my face itches for a few seconds after applying. My skin feels very smooth and a few laugh lines have faded but I’m concerned about why my face reacts with itching. This does not happen when I apply it to my neck. Also while my skin feels smooth it does not feel moist. I guess that’s because it absorbs very quickly. It could also be due to the fact that its winter and the air is so dry. It is unscented but I do prefer a little scent in my skincare items. Anyway, La Roche-Posay did not live up to all the hype and I doubt I will purchase this again."
"February 06, 2024","lightweight, blends well","I recently switched to this product after using another brand for many years. It's a nice, lightweight moisturizer, white in color, that blends in well with my pale, white skin. I can't feel it on my face when I'm wearing it, but when I touch my face, it feels smooth and moisturized. It only takes a little bit of product to cover my face, neck, and ears, so the tube should last a long time, and the cost is 1/4 of what I used to pay for my old product."
"January 31, 2024",Great for every skin,This is a great medium moisturizer for all skin types. I’ve used it by itself during more humid conditions and with a moisturizing toner during dryer times of the year. Wears well under makeup and sunscreen. No fragrance and no irritation! Highly recommend!
"January 12, 2024",I love La Roche-Posay,I love this moisturizer. It’s the best one I’ve ever tried.
"January 11, 2024",Nice texture and seems to work,"The texture is light and it does seem to help the skin. I am a daily tretinoin user and I've found products with Niacinamide sometimes cause a reaction on my skin- irritation and flaking skin. If I go back to using ""normal"" moisturizer it clears up. Nothing wrong with this moisturizer but I can't use it daily with the tretinoin. Otherwise it would get 5 starts."
"January 04, 2024",Delivers,"Does exactly what it promises. Moisturizing, none irritating and helps calm redness. The price is unbeatable for a quality product."
"January 02, 2024",such a great moisturizer,Love this product so much! Highly recommend. Inexpensive but high quality
"December 29, 2023",Good Quality,This is my favorite moisturizer. It's formulated without ingredients that irritate my skin or cause more acne. The price is not too bad considering the quality and consistency of the results. I use it AM and PM as part of my daily routine.
"December 28, 2023",La Roche-Posay,"This is a product I never run out of. I like to put this on at night after my retinol. This is what works for me, a wonderful product."
"December 25, 2023",crumbles and peels off of face. does not soak in,Cannot put under make up. literally balls up when rubbed and comes off face.
"December 17, 2023",FEELS LIKE SILK,I am a 72 year old who is very fair and use moisturizers 2x per day. This product is very silky and absorbs nicely into the skin. A little amount goes a long way. The price is reasonable as compared to other moisturizers. This the first time using the product and will be purchasing it again in the near future.
"December 16, 2023",Moisturizer,This is one of my favorite moisturizers. I’m left with a nice dewy glow.
"December 06, 2023",La Roche-Posay,"This Toleriane Double Reopair Face Moisturizer is far the best I have been fortunate to find. It has all the ingredients of a lot of high end and its more than half the cost. Lightweight, melts into your skin and stays moisturized all day!! Wonderful product!! Mt skin never looked so good!!!"
"November 18, 2023",Staple in my skincare regimen!,"This is my third bottle of the LRP Toleriane Moisturiser. I like it because it is hydrating without feeling heavy, and I feel my skin health has improved with the addition of ceramides. I mostly use it at night and use the UV version in the morning. However, this also layers well under a separate SPF if that is your preference."
"November 18, 2023",Great Facial Moisturizer,"I have dry skin with mild rosacea. I read about La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer in a magazine and decided to try it. I am very happy I did. My skin feels softer, and it helps tone down the red when my rosacea is acting up. It's also a reasonable price point. Very happy with this product."
"November 17, 2023",Nice and light,Hydrates skin without clogging pores and does not look greasy. Helps soothe skin and decreases redness. Didn’t cause me to break out. Like that it is not scented.
"November 16, 2023",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is one of the few that doesn’t cause my skin to breakout. I use it twice daily, and my skin never lacks moisture."
"November 05, 2023",Quality Product,Love there products! This one isn’t too heavy or too light.
"October 14, 2023",Doesn’t Absorb,"Not a fan. I like that the lightweight formula doesn’t clog my pores, but the moisturizer just sits on my skin and doesn’t absorb. I know this because if I rub the skin on my face after the moisturizer has dried, like to blend in a concealer, the moisturizer pills off."
"October 11, 2023",LOVEE IT!,"This moisturizer has been a great hit for me! I love how it works for my combination skin, it has soothed, softened and has healed my damaged skin barrier. I love how this moisturizer hydrates my skin through the night, I love the ingredients it has, niacinamide, to control oil in my T zone, and ceramides to improve and soothe my skin. I would definitely recommend this if you have combination or normal skin. I would say this is a great alternative if you are looking for a high quality drugstore moisturizer that nearly performs like a high end one."
"October 01, 2023",Double Repair Face Moisturizer,I have been using this for several years now. It goes on so smoothly and moisturizes as good as or better than some of the more expensive brands. An added plus is that it's unscented!
"September 29, 2023",Amazed,"I am amazed at how wonderful this moisturizer is for the price! Its regular pricing is inexpensive compared to so many others, but getting it during a Lovely Skin sale is even better! I have tried many moisturizers but this is the only one that doesn't cause breakouts, feels great on my skin, actually moisturizes, and can be used both before makeup and before bed. You really cannot go wrong with this one!"
"September 27, 2023",Great cream,Love — such a great moisturizer. Makes my face feel refreshed. Great for night time.
"September 26, 2023",Perfect daily moisturizer,Love the texture of this formula it melts into your skin! Perfect for all skin types I would say! I use morning and night and I will for life!
"September 08, 2023",Good quality,I like the light texture of this moisturizer. If my skin feels too dry from the retin-a then I apply two layers. It doesn’t feel greasy nor heavy.
"September 04, 2023",Great everyday facial moisturizer,"Great daily facial moisturizer, especially for dry skin. This is great to wear overnight in dry environments, also. I would recommend testing out a small sample first if you have acne-prone skin."
"September 01, 2023",Perfect Moisturizer!,It really works well as a nighttime moisturizer. I use all these products from occasional eczema.
"September 01, 2023","Really like it, thick but not heavy",Moisturizing and thick. Lot for a good price. For sensitive skin
"September 01, 2023",Drug store moisturizer with a luxury feel,"I have tried all kinds of moisturizers from many price ranges and I always come back to this one. It is readily available and feels so wonderful on my skin. Does not break me out and mixes well with my other products, especially my tinted sunscreen."
"August 26, 2023",Dewy skin,I received this as a sample and decided to purchase it after how dewy it looked on my skin. Will continue to use it .
"August 26, 2023",love this brand!,Gret moisturizer for my skin after I use my retinol regimen.
"August 24, 2023",I am impressed how well it works!,"First time user of La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer. I was skeptical at first, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I apply it every night after Retin A. My skin is no longer ‘angry’ in the morning!"
"August 18, 2023",Great daily moisturizer!,I use tretinoin every night for my acne-prone skin which can sometimes cause my skin a lot of irritation. I’ve been searching for a moisturizer that takes care of irritation and flakiness without causing breakouts and this is definitely the one! This is absolutely a staple in my skin care routine!
"July 31, 2023",Excellent,I've been experiencing red and itchy skin around my eyes for several months and have tried a number of moisturizers. Thank goodness I heard La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer recommended by a dermatologist on YouTube as it has helped so much. It doesn't seep into my eyes and cause irritation even though I apply it to upper and lower lids a few times a day.
"July 24, 2023",Great quality,I have tried so many products but nothing compares to this moisturizer. The quality of this product is exceedingly comparable to any other moisturizer. the price is also unbeatable! I will totally repurchase this again.
"July 23, 2023",Great Basic,This is a strong moisturizer at a great price point.
"July 16, 2023","Love, love, love",Wonderful moisturizer. This soaks right in and I can layer it over other products without any problem. Another great product from this brand.
"June 28, 2023",Great for mature sensitive skin,"I switched from Epionce moisturizers to this L-P double repair moisturizer. It is just as gentle and moisturizing, and very affordable. Great for my mature sensitive skin with rosacea."
"June 23, 2023",Very good.,Not greasy and very light on skin. Did not cause breakout!
"June 22, 2023",Awesome,I use this at night. My oily scene prone skin loves it. Been using it for years.
"June 16, 2023",Excellent Face Moisturizer,"For whatever reason, my face has gotten exponentially dry over the past year. I have tried multiple products trying to find something that would provide the right level of moisturizer. Thus far, this one is the best. I don’t have problems with piling and my face feels much better throughout the day. It works well under my makeup. If you are looking for a good moisturizer, please give this one a try."
"June 16, 2023",good moisturizer,This is a great moisturizer that absorbs well and leaves my skin healthy looking.
"June 09, 2023",Lightweight but moisturizing,This moisturizer is great for dry or dry to combination skin. I use it both morning and night. It's light enough for daytime use and also great at the end of my nighttime routine.
"June 08, 2023","Good, but not life changing","This has been a good, cheap moisturizer for me during the summer when I need something lighter, but it definitely hasn't changed my life or anything. I think when this runs out, I'll try another moisturizer for summer months. Still haven't found the right one for me!"
"June 05, 2023",Heavy Moisturizer,This lotion is thick! I prefer to put this on at night to repair or during the day when I feel like I need a little extra moisture. I also appreciate that it is a larger bottle. I’ll definitely be purchasing again.
"May 31, 2023",Great moisturizer,"This is a great moisturizer! I am a 51-year-old woman with combo to oily skin, prone to breaking out from two heavy skin care products. This does not make me break out, it seems to give me a good balance of hydration for my type of skin. Highly recommend !!"
"May 30, 2023",Great moisturizer,"My facialist gave me a sample of this moisturizer after I had a peel or other treatment, and she said to use it for a few days since my skin was particularly sensitive. I loved it, and I purchased a full size product shortly afterwards. It's light but moisturizing and I think it will be great in the upcoming summer months when I don't want a heavy moisturizer."
"May 10, 2023",Good one for dry skin,I use it as my daily moisturizer when I am staying working from home. I have oily skin so it does leave my skin too shiny for my taste but it does moisturizes really nice. I guess it works better for dry skin
"May 06, 2023",Good summer moisturizer,"It is a light moisturizer—a little too light for winter. However, I think as we move from spring into summer that this moisturizer is very nice. I have sensitive skin and this caused no irritation at all. I like it and recommend."
"May 05, 2023",The best,Finally found solution for dry mature skin!
"May 02, 2023",Amazing moisturizer,"Amazing moisturizer, hydrating, leave my skin so soft and is perfect after using my retinol, doesn’t leave my skin dry and is perfect"
"May 01, 2023",Great moisturizer - works as intended,Great moisturizer for oily combination skin
"April 25, 2023",Just okay,There is truly nothing special about this. Don’t love the texture and not very moisturizing. I love lots of products from the brand but this one is just very generic
"April 20, 2023",The best cream ever!!!,"The best cream ever!!! I needed something for skin barrier repair since I used too much of Aha/ Bha acne products. This cream is skin savior, it is super moisturizing but never oily, never piles up on face, great under makeup. It is my third order I will be using forever it is so great."
"April 19, 2023",Good stuff,"I like this lotion and I use it for my neck and chest for the sunscreen aspect. I like the texture and the moisture it provides, but it’s just a tad greasy on my skin."
"April 12, 2023",Great Day Lotion,I wear this every morning when I go to the gym. It is light enough for working out but creates a a wonderful moisture barrier to keep my skin hydrated. It has a very mild pleasant scent.
"April 08, 2023",Great moisturizer!,"Another great product from La-roche posay. Feels so good on my allergy, red, dry skin. No harsh chemicals- only the good stuff. Highly recommend trying this for your face!"
"April 07, 2023",Great Daily Moisturizer!,I am writing this review on behalf of my husband who has been using this product for nearly 3 years. He doesn't like moisturizers that leave a heavy feeling or shine on his skin. This one is just right to leave his skin balanced and moisturized in any season of the year. He uses it after his evening shower and applies the version with sunscreen during the day time.
"March 30, 2023",Great for sensitive skin,Use this as an everyday moisturizer.
"March 30, 2023",Good moisturizing,Many dermatologists recommended this item.
"March 27, 2023",Fine for day use,I find this to be good for daytime use under makeup but not a great moisturizer for night time use. Very light and does absorb quickly.
"March 27, 2023",Toleriane double repair,"This product is mostly used by my 17 year old daughter. She has tricky teenage skin with its share of breakouts, etc. However, she is also dry so most acne products leave her dry and flaking. This moisturizer is her exclusive go-to for a.m. and pm moisturizing. It keeps her skin balanced and moisturized without clogging pores. I have tried it (53 years w/combo-dry skin) and it is good for am but I prefer a very thick pm moisturizer. This has really kept her skin in great shape and is a very simple routine that anyone can follow."
"March 27, 2023",Love!,This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It keeps my skin well hydrated. I use it to lock in my serums and to serve as a protective coating. And the price point is fantastic!
"March 23, 2023",Perfect lightweight moisturizer,Doesn’t clog pores and is the perfect weight for spring and summer. My esthetician said she also uses this! Good value as well
"March 16, 2023",Love,"Great, simple everyday lotion. I have sensitive skin and I’m allergic to preservatives found in just about every product. I can safely use this and it just hydrated my skin. I love it."
"February 27, 2023",Great face cream,My face is really dry and this cream feels great! It is not heavy and keeps my face moisturized.
"February 27, 2023",Double Repair Face Moisturizer,This is a great product. I have very dry skin and I use this product morning and evening - it keeps my face feeling moisturized and soft. Really like it.
"February 22, 2023","great for dry, sensitive skin","For me, this is the better facial moisturizer as between this one and La Roche-Posay's Toleriane Dermallergo pump-version moisturizer. The latter is a bit lighter, but this one is richer, which I prefer, and is also in simpler packaging, a simple squeeze bottle rather than a pump that sometimes clogs. I recommend this facial moisturizer for those with sensitive, dry facial skin, as its softening, moisturizing effects last into the next day."
"February 19, 2023",Great Daily Moisturizer,"This is a great moisturizer option for during the day. It's not too heavy, not too light. Just the right weight for daily use."
"February 18, 2023",Good for dry skin,"I use this when my face is flaky, ultra dry, or red. It is safe and feels relieving when my skin is in a sensitive state. Rating a 4 because I wouldn’t say it’s “double repair” quality."
"February 17, 2023",Okay,I won't be buying this again. Not great for dry skin. I will be sticking with other brands.
"February 11, 2023",Great moisturizer,Great moisture. Have re-purchased 3 times now. Really good price.
"February 10, 2023",Good No Fuss Moisturizer,"As with most skincare products, it took about a week before I fully appreciated it! It is a good no fuss moisturizer with other products that have active ingredients! Not too light not too heavy."
"January 28, 2023",Pretty good,"I love all La Roche products! This moisturizer works very well, only issue was pilling. I think it does not mix well with some of my other products."
"January 20, 2023",Double Repair,I do love many La Roche-Posay products. I think this product would be better for me in the summer season rather than during winter months. It just isn’t enough of a moisturizer during winter months.
"January 16, 2023",Finally something that works,"My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I loved it. Decided to get it for my dry winter skin. I find that I do need to reapply it around noon time, but overall it's a lot better than other brands I've been trying. Will be repurchasing."
"January 15, 2023",Light yet moisturizing,I have very dry skin in the winter. This lotion is moisturizing but not greasy. Easily absorbed
"January 09, 2023",Good basic moisturizer,"I am a repeat buyer of this product. It is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, even post procedure. Because of the good price point, I can use it generously."
"January 07, 2023",Dry skin,"I was so hopeful that this would make my super dry skin, feel moist and soft. However, it did not do the job and I still feel dry and need to use an alternative moisturizer :("
"January 06, 2023",Just ok,This product is just ok. It seems to only sit on top of my skin and not add hydration or moisture.
"January 06, 2023",LOVE! w/tretinoin and acne,"47 years old - Everything makes my face breakout…not this. Using tretinoin nightly, Cica Baum over it and no drying. Use it on my lips, my cuticles…LOVE!"
"January 06, 2023",Reasonably priced,I first tried this products sunscreen and was impressed. I'm glad I took a chance on the moisturizer. It was reasonably priced and just as good as some more expensive products. Would easily purchase again.
"December 31, 2022",Savior during winter time,"Purchased for my husband after he complained about dryness but refused to use my serums and masks. He is very happy with this moisturizer, easy to put on and long lasting too!"
"December 22, 2022",Great winter night moisturizer for my face,"This is my ""go to"" winter night moisturizer for my face. It is thick and mosturizing for dry chapped skin and works well to wear overnight."
"December 22, 2022",La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,This is a great moisturizer It doesn’t breakout my skin as many others have! my teen daughter loves it too!
"December 16, 2022",For irritation,"I have sensitive, redness prone, normal-to-dry skin with acne rosacea. Double Repair Moisturizer is one of the best for irritated areas from retinol. I get breakouts if I use it all over my face, though, so I can only use it to spot treat."
"December 09, 2022",Love it!,Very soft on the skin and gets absorbed fast.
"December 09, 2022",Good,This moisturizer is pretty good. Gentle and hydrating. I have moistly oily skin and use this to spot treat when I have an area that is having some sensitivity for some reason from actives.
"December 09, 2022",Redness,I liked the feel of the product but realized my skin was getting red from using it. I have never had that reaction before from other products that I have ordered on this site.
"December 06, 2022",Excellent for Sensitive Skin,I was recently diagnosed with excema and had to change up my skincare routine. This moisture helped tremendously with the Chicago cold dry air. Very impressed.
"December 05, 2022",Good moisturizer,"This is a nice moisturizer, I like to use it at night. I also appreciate that it is reasonably priced considering it contains ceramide and niacinamide."
"November 29, 2022",Nice moisturizer,Just started using this but noticed quick absorption and non-greasy feel. My skin feels softer too.
"November 26, 2022",Great!,"This one does its job! Great moisturizer, non sticky, it absorbs pretty fast. Would definitely recommend."
"November 19, 2022",Great for dry skin,This is a great moisturizer. It leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated without feeling greasy. This is becoming one of my favorite brands.
"November 18, 2022",Really nice,This is a great daytime moisturizer! Pretty light and easily absorbed. Will repurchase.
"November 17, 2022",Healthy and refreshed,My skin feels refreshed and gets rid of any dryness
"November 17, 2022",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,I love this moisturizer! Keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. Also does not clog pores so no breakouts! I will buy again!
"November 14, 2022",Love it,"I was experience flaking issues and after a consultation with a physician’s assistant at Lovely Skin recommended this product, I have not considered a change. Great, non greasy and also available with SPF 30. Use it every day with the SPF and straight at night."
"November 08, 2022",First-Time User...LOVE IT!,I love this moisturizer! My skin feels so soft after using it...it's a must-have!
"November 08, 2022",Love this moisturizer,This is a great moisturizer. Softens skin and lasts all day. I just ordered 2 more
"November 08, 2022","Love, Love, Love Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer","This is the one product I would bring with me if I was stranded on a desert island. It is so soothing, and moisturizing, and doesn't have any ingredients that make my face flare-up."
"November 02, 2022",Amazing moisturizer,"This is a great product, it works for all type of skins, my skin is very dry, and my daughter is a teenager, with a beautiful completion, but with the teenager's challenges. We both use toleraine double repair, it hydrates our skin, does not clog pores, and maintains our faces moisturized all day long."
"October 29, 2022",La Roche Posay Moisturizer,Great product. I highly recommend. My skin looks softer. I highly recommend this product
"October 26, 2022",Top Moisturizer,"This is one of my go to moisturizers, I have probably repurchased more than a hand full of times. The price point is not only very attractive, but the product itself hydrates your skin with out feeling heavy. Definitely a great day to day basic moisturizer. A took off a star since lately the product has been peeling upon applying makeup. This had never happened until my last 2 purchased bottles."
"October 09, 2022",One of the best skin moisturizers I have used,"I have tried so many facial moisturizers, trying to find the “holy grail.” Most of them have been well over $100 and did not work very well. This an excellent moisturizer. I mix it with my sunscreen during the day and layer with La Roche-Posay’s eczema cream at night. I live in Colorado, where it is very dry year round."
"September 29, 2022",La Roche Moisturizer,Effective at getting rid of wrinkles...only limitation is that there is no SPF Sunscreen so you will need another product for that protection.
"September 27, 2022","Best ""bland"" moisturizer for counteracting actives",You always hear about using Retin-a or other actives and buffering or otherwise using an un-fragranced moisturizer. This is mine. Will always order.
"September 20, 2022",Favorite every day moisturizer,Love this moisturizer! My face is super sensitive with dry and acne prone skin. This gives me the moisture my skin so desperately needs without it feeling overly heavy on my face or clogging my pores. Definitely recommend!
"September 17, 2022",Effective daytime moisturizer!,I’ve enjoyed the benefits of using this daily. It’s just as good as a high end moisturizer.
"September 09, 2022",Favorite moisturizer,I've used it first then bought it for my husband as well. We love it. Good moisturizer with good price.
"August 25, 2022",Amazing moisturizer!,Love this moisturizer!! I will continue to buy this over and over! Very lightweight and not sticky!
"August 19, 2022",The best,I have tried many moisturizers and this one is the best. As soon as you apply you can feel it working immediately. And continues all day.
"August 18, 2022",Too heavy,Made me break out.
"August 09, 2022",Absorbs quickly,Nice moisturizer for summer. Will probably not be good for winter months if your skins tends to be dry.
"August 08, 2022",Did not work out as well as I wanted!,"I bought this for a rosacea breakout on my chest, did ok, absorbs well but certainly not as effective as other moisturizing products I’ve used. I gave it 4 stars because the price is reasonable & overall it did not do any harm!"
"August 05, 2022",Good basic moisturizer,I wanted a basic moisturizer that wasn't too expensive since I use expensive serums. This one fit the bill. I like that it includes niacinamide.
"July 31, 2022",So hydrating,This is so creamy and light. It makes your face feel so good and it is not greasy. There is no smell.
"July 30, 2022",Wonderful light moisturizer,Perfect for normal/oily skin. The niacinamide is evening out my skin tone. La roche posay is transforming my skin!
"July 29, 2022",Surprisingly nice. The reviews weren’t wrong,This is thicker than what I would normally use but very absorbent and non greasy. No irritants and no fragrance. I use it mainly at night and like it.
"July 28, 2022",Always a great brand,Love all roche posey products and this is no exception. Very soothing and moisturizing.
"July 24, 2022",Perfect for oily skin,I have pretty oily skin and it has been difficult finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me feel oily by the end of the day. I love using this facial moisturizer and have been using it for a few months now. It is light and has great coverage. Will definitely purchase again.
"July 23, 2022",Calms and hydrated skin,Love this moisturizer- so much that I bought stock in the company!
"July 21, 2022",The Best,This moisturizer is perfect. It leaves your skin feeling so soft without being greasy.
"July 18, 2022",As described- works,Purchased based on positive reviews and agreed that this daily face lotion is great! Recommend
"July 16, 2022",Hydrating,"This lotion is hydrating and moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. The one thing I do recommend is if you wear makeup over you need to put a primer on first or the lotion and makeup will peel. I bought this when the Obagi hydrating moisturizer was out of stock to give it a try. I still like the Obagi much better, but this will work in the interim."
"July 15, 2022",Calming and Hydrating,"I use this moisturizer year-round. It has the perfect consistency and absorbs quickly, leaving my redness prone skin calm and hydrated."
"July 12, 2022",My New Holy Grail,"I love this rich moisturizer. Though it feels rich and moisturizing, it doesn't feel heavy on skin. The formulation is just perfect and it doesn't give me pimples nor any reactions. It is a must in every woman's skincare!"
"July 09, 2022",Love it,"Use at night, it's part of my skin routine. It's so soft & creamy. It definitely repairs my skin overnight."
"July 07, 2022",Perfect,"I've been using La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer for years. It's part of my daily routine. I like it for its moisturizing properties and it contains niacinamide. The best part of all, it is unscented, a must for me."
"July 07, 2022",Silky Smooth,"I purchased this after having a sample come to me in the mail. It is silky smooth, great for sensitive skin and has a very light non greasy feel to it. I put this on after my shower and have seen some good results so far, as less dry and smoother complexion. I am 63 & have some sun damage. Highly recommend and this site had the best price of any place I looked."
"July 05, 2022",Nice neutral moisturizer,Nice light-weight moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin.
"July 04, 2022",La Roche-Posay,"Compared to other cleansers, I felt this cleanser did not clean as effectively and I needed to use a lot of it. I have combination skin. Perhaps it is better suited for very dry skin. But even then, I am not sure how effective it is for removing makeup, etc."
"June 19, 2022",A great product,"I have very dry, sensitive skin and this product is my go to after micro needling when my skin has settled down but needs lots of moisture and protection. It’s inexpensive, un scented, easily absorbed and does not cause pimples."
"June 18, 2022",La Roche-Posay double repair face moisturizer,"I like the face moisturize, I have very sensitive skin, sofar it has work well for me. It takes care of the red from the rosacea."
"June 14, 2022",La roche posay toleriane double repair face moisturizer,"This moisturizer is really good ,and very hydrated .It is not greasy and itis a good price. I recommend it"
"June 10, 2022",My go to moisturizer!,"Lightweight, but very nourishing!"
"June 10, 2022",Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,"I've been using it for a couple weeks on a rough part of my face, in lieu of Toleriane Ultra. So far, the Double Repair Face Moisturizer seems to be working fine on that portion of my face."
"June 06, 2022",Pills,"In my experience, this product pilled on my skin. It felt as if it sat on top of my skin, instead of sinking in. However, it never caused irritation or a reaction and I like the ingredients; just didn't work for me."
"May 28, 2022",Great for the Price,"I have been using this moisturizer when I don't need the sunscreen protection, like at night. It does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated, without a greasy, heavy feeling."
"May 24, 2022",Most hydrating moisturizer,This cream is easily absorbed and light weight and most importantly it hydrates deeply and reduces redness.
"May 23, 2022",Best Light Moisturizer,My skin isn’t as dry in the summer months so my heavy winter moisturizer can break me out. This is my favorite light moisturizer.
"May 15, 2022",Fantastic moisturizer….best product,I am reviewing based on a sample and I just purchased a full size. This moisturizer hands down is the best for my skin. I have combo and now in warmer weather other products would make and show a greasy shiny face. This product gives a terrific matte finish and feels so nourishing to my face. Best product ever. So happy after 30 yrs I have found a product that actually works for me.
"May 15, 2022",highly recommended,"I live in Hawaii and have sensitive combination skin. I was looking for something that is easily absorbed in the morning before I apply my sunscreen. Some moisturizers do not absorb that well and I need something to work fast as I get ready in the morning. After trying soooo many different things, I finally found something that works. I use this and then about 5 minutes or so later I can apply my sunscreen and I am good to go. Give it a try, you won't regret it."
"May 12, 2022",Great for my increasingly sensitive skin,"I had to switch up my skincare products, especially the moisturizers, because I've developed perioral contact dermatitis that has been persistent for a year. My dermatologist told me that botanical ingredients, especially hyaluronic acid, are common culprits. Have always liked LaRoche Posay products so was happy to find this moisturizer fit my needs for products with no HA. A little bit goes a long way, it goes on smoothly, and my skin is recovering nicely while still hydrated."
"May 11, 2022",Double Repair Facial Moisturizer,"I have tried this product several times but it pills when trying to apply my makeup, leaves my skin looking very greasy and has caused clogged pores with break outs. Not a fan."
"May 06, 2022",Great Product for Sensitive skin,"This is a wonderful moisturizer. I have sensitive skin, irritates easily especially when temperature changes. This product is a good daily moisturizer- calms my skin, is quickly absorbed and light weight- great for summer. I use other high end moisturizers but when my skin needs a break, it's great to rotate this in my regime."
"May 05, 2022",Smooth and moisturizes,It’s perfect for my teen daughter who also uses the La Roche cleanser and toner. It’s light and yet moisturizing. Highly recommend.
"April 18, 2022",Good moisturizer for sensitive skin,"This moisturizer works quite well for my skin that is oily and acne-prone while also being gentle for my rosacea. The only thing I don’t like is that my skin does appear pretty greasy when I use it, but it does not make me break out."
"April 09, 2022",Lovely,I used it again and again
"April 08, 2022",New to the brand,"I bought this for severe dehydration under my eyes as I live in the desert and had a procedure done back in dec. This is an unscented, rich, facial moisturizer that i am really enjoying and feel is actually helping. I have told my family about this brand."
"April 04, 2022",Holy Grail!,"Dermatologist recommended! A virtual dupe for some of the expensive moisturizers. Works great for my dry, mature skin."
"March 29, 2022",Nice,Feels like a cheaper brand… can’t tell any difference.. so I don’t bother to repurchase this I have the other brand in much better price…
"March 28, 2022",Great moisturizer!,"This moisturizer has made a world of difference in my skin, I've noticed less redness and my face feels moisturized without a greasy residue."
"March 24, 2022",It’s ok,It’s a decent moisturizer I just find that it pills up and flakes off in to my hairline.
"March 23, 2022",Double Repair moisturizer,Not my favorite moisturizer. I will use it occasionally until it's gone but I don't foresee repurchasing it.
"March 17, 2022",A great basic moisturizer,I use this moisturizer twice a day. It hydrates my dry skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I like that it works well with all my other La Roche Posay products. A winner!
"March 15, 2022",Very Moisturizing!,Absolutely love this product. It moisturizes my face and at a fair price!
"March 14, 2022",Love this...and it's affordable!,So happy to find a moisturizer that delivers results without a huge price tag!
"March 13, 2022",Great everyday moisturizer,"This is a great moisturizer for daily use on combination skin. However, it won't help with very dry skin."
"March 13, 2022",I like it,I just started using this about a month ago. I've been pretty loyal to SkinCeuticals for a while now but it's expensive. This seems to be a nice option that's not so pricey. So far so good.
"March 11, 2022",Best moisturizer for sensitive skin,I love this moisturizer for sensitive skin. It hydrates deeply and reduces redness. Great to use in the AM and PM.
"March 11, 2022",Best moisturizer AND affordable too!,I’ve tried so many (read expensive) moisturizers and none have come close to this one. It is affordable and makes me skin feel amazing. 10/10 recommend
"March 08, 2022",Good daily moisturizer.,I have sensitive skin and I love this brand in general. Great basic moisturizer - never had any issues.
"March 04, 2022",Only face moisturizer that I will use,My dermatologist recommended the Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer and I couldn't be happier. I have tried numerous facial moisturizers and this is the first one that feels as if it's not there. Very smooth and velvety. Very easy to put makeup on over.
"March 01, 2022",love this lotion,My favorite lotion to use when my face is dry. It doesn't make me feel oily or breakout like most lotions.
"March 01, 2022",Just Right!,absorbs quickly and lightweight. my teenage daughter has sensitive skin and this is her go-to moisturizer.
"February 28, 2022",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturize,A very good moisturizer. Makes my skins look healthy and hydrated. I will purchase again.
"February 23, 2022",Face Moisturizer,"I thought this would be just another moisturizer, but my face is so dry, especially in the winter, I thought I would try it. I am so glad I did. I use it on my face and neck a couple times a day. Within a week, my dry face has significantly improved. I will never use another face moisturizer.. seriously."
"February 21, 2022",recommended,helped with skin texture
"February 20, 2022",Early Review,I have been using this for two weeks now and i really love it. I have not had any breakouts or red blotches from it and it absorbs completely. I also feel like I see a difference already as my face seems brightened and feels soft and not dry or oily
"February 18, 2022",This is great stuff!!,"This is a moisturizer I use on my neck because I am so dry there, I have been using it for years now and don't want to be without it."
"February 11, 2022",Loving it,"I have found this moisturizer recently. It is just perfect. A combination of ceramides, niacinamide and prebiotic thermal water that protects and strenghtens my skin barrier. In addition it does not have fragance, making it perfect for sensitive skin."
"February 07, 2022",Great Everyday Lotion,"Great lotion that doesn’t break the bank. Always have on hand with running low on higher end lotions and definitely is comparable. Works well under makeup, too!"
"February 04, 2022",Good find for the price,"I like this moisturizer especially considering the price point. I like that it has anti-aging ingredients, is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy and doesn’t cause breakouts"
"February 02, 2022",Moisturizer fanrastique!,Love this moisturizer! Quickly absorbed! Non-greasy! Very effective!
"February 01, 2022",I like it!,I like using this product at night ONLY and during winter weather. It is very hydrated. My skin feels very protective after applying this cream. This moisturizer does not go well under my foundation because my foundation peels on top of it. Only recommend it for a night only!
"February 01, 2022",Great product,Excellent and very reasonably priced. Great moisturizer
"January 18, 2022",perfect moisturizer,"This very soothing, creamy moisturizer glides on and into the skin without a greasy or pilling finish. It layers perfectly with other products, and has a prolonged effect. The best moisturizer I have used in 40 some years!"
"January 14, 2022",When I don't need sun protection...,"I use this moisturizer; doesn't cause break-outs, and works well under my foundation."
"January 13, 2022",Perfect,I really like this product. Leaves my skin feel dewey fresh. Great price!
"January 07, 2022",Dissapointed,"I had lot of expectation for this product - ingredients and texture seemed great and I thought it would be great as my evening moisturizer. However, there was a lot of pilling and peeling after I put it on. Perhaps it had something to do with using retinol serum first, but I don't have this experience with other moisturizers."
"January 03, 2022",Great price good quantity,"La Roche products are really nice, they have no scent and work great on senstive skin in my opnion. This is a nice sized tube and not greasy"
"January 03, 2022",Daily moisturizer,I use this daily for my morning moisturizer!
"December 30, 2021",Love this product,This product was given to me as a sample from my dermatologist. I was very impressed with how my face felt after using for a few days. I ordered more immediately and have used it daily since then. My skin is more smooth to the touch and I love the bit of tingle it provides when applying.
"December 30, 2021",Nice texture,"This moisturizer is light, no too thick and doesn’t sit on top of my skin."
"December 28, 2021",Excellent basic moisturizer,"I've been using this moisturizer for about a year and I love it. It's a basic moisturizer, bit it has a luxurious feeling to it. Hydrates very well and works well for my combination skin."
"December 28, 2021",LaRoche-Posay,I am very happy with this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. A little goes a long way and it can be used as a night cream as well. It’s also a very affordable price.
"December 28, 2021",Great for sensitive skin,My face skin is very sensitive to a lots of chemicals. La Roche-Posay is my choice for facial cream. It moistures my skin but doesn’t irritate it.
"December 17, 2021",Does the job,"Light, non greasy capable moisturizer. Been using for few years. Tried many others always return to this one."
"December 14, 2021",Great value and product,"This is a wonderful daily moisturizer that is not expensive, but works well. It keeps my winter skin well moisturized, and doesn't feel greasy on my skin. It goes on smooth and soaks in quickly. It has become a regular in my skincare routine."
"December 13, 2021",Best moisturizer ever!,"This is my favorite product, it really works! Everything from La Roche-Posay is great!"
"December 11, 2021",Nice moisturizer for combination skin!,"I finally found a great moisturizer that does not clog my pores! Also, I tend to get oily around my eyes and they will start to itch and burn because of the sebum. This moisturizer will act as a barrier for my eyes and somewhat control my sebum!"
"December 07, 2021",Very Serviceable Product,"This is my first go-round with LR-P Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer, and so far I like it very much. When I first started using it I broke out in several areas, but after a few days the breakouts disappeared and stopped altogether. I assume my (sensitive) skin needed to adjust to the unfamiliar ingredients. The only drawback, and this is on me for not reading the label closely enough, is this one doesn't have a sun protection factor. Next time I purchase, I'll look for that SPF on the label. Otherwise I'm very happy with this moisturizer."
"December 06, 2021",Hydrating,So far using as of 2 weeks and am happy with it
"December 05, 2021",So Far....Good....,"Fall/winter months & medical grade skincare & treatments will leave my skin yearning for moisture. I didn't have a daily moisturizer factored into my daily skin regimen usually my Vit. C cream was my moisturizer BUT I did notice my tinted moisturizer, foundation, powder/liquid looked much better on a well moist face especially on area of face that are drier. I chose this brand & did like the ingredients, my face is sensitive & I've had no neg. reaction. The moisturizer is thick, soaks well into skin, not greasy & overall great!!"
"December 04, 2021",Great moisturizer,"With so many serums & treatments being produced for your skin, it is wonderful to have a moisturizer with calming ingredients that is reasonably priced & does its job of moisturizing. This does not ""interfere"" with my Retin-A or my AHA."
"December 04, 2021",Good but Not Great,"The lotion is moisturizing, but not as much as I thought it would be after reading other reviews. Not sure I would purchase again."
"December 01, 2021",Love this as a last step for extra protection and moisture,I have been so impressed with the La Roche brand and this is no exception - happy to add this to my collection for my super sensitive and dry skin - it works well when I apply atop my serum/beauty oil micro emulsion routine.
"November 28, 2021",LaRoch-Posay Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer,"Anything by La Roche-Posay is a good product, but to create such reasonably priced creme using prebiotic thermal water was a genius of a product. I have normal skin which dries out winter time and so I was used layers of potions, lotions to keep it moist. With that moisturizer you don’t need much, your skin absorbs it easily and immediately becomes velvety soft. I also use it on my hands, better than some hand cremes. Highly recommend the product and I would imagine if it’s after a procedure that creme would be a great addition to the routine."
"November 21, 2021",Not suitable for my skin,"I have a very dry and sensitive skin. I decided to try this moisturizer because i really like the hyaluronic acid serum and the gentle cleanser, but this does not moisturizes my skin as much as i need. It also irritates my skin a little."
"November 21, 2021",Amazing,I have very sensitive skin and this brand never fails. Amazing product.
"November 20, 2021",Best affordable moisturize!,Have been using for 5 years. It is the best. Come in non-oily too!
"November 20, 2021",Great Moisturizer,Not greasy and thank goodness no fragrance. Have used for years and will continue to.
"November 17, 2021",Worth every penny,"I was looking for a moisturizer that wasn’t going to break my bank, was made of quality ingredients, and wouldn’t be too heavy. I LOVE this stuff. I made the switch to this and my face and wallet are happy about it! :)"
"November 16, 2021",Good product but not for me,"This moisturizer is silky, moisturizing, and has some great ingredients. Unfortunately, my skin responded negatively to the Niacinamide. I had itchy red bumps on my face. I have very sensitive skin. If you don't react to this type of ingredient, this is a great choice."
"November 14, 2021",Immediate Skin Repair,"Bought after trying a sample. In order to keep my skin oil free and clean, I've been using products that sometimes can be too irritating. LRP Double Repair Face Moisturizer has helped repair my skin almost immediately. It doesn't clog my pores nor feels greasy at all. The price is the cherry on the top!"
"November 13, 2021",Makes my skin silky,I love this moisturizer. So hydrating and makes my skin so soft and silky. I will buy it again for sure.
"November 12, 2021",Great product,"Love the way this moisturizer feels on my skin. It’s so economical, I use it all over after showering."
"November 08, 2021",Recommend this product,Did not clear the rash on my face but has kept it from itching and makes my face feel smooth without being greasy.
"November 08, 2021",Double repair Moisturizer,"Very nice lightweight moisturizer. Doesn't set on top of your skin, feels like it sinks right in. Also great for sensitive skin, no fragrance."
"November 07, 2021",Light. Non Irritating. Suitable for Tropical and Hot climate,The moisture is light and does not irritate. There are no fragrances which I love. It is perfect for hot tropical climates where a heavy moisturizer will be uncomfortable. It is easy to apply. Affordable. Seals well after use.
"November 02, 2021",My new go-to moisturizer,"Instead of spending $$ on an expensive moisturizer, I've prioritized target serums and then was seeking a lightweight soothing moisturizer that I can use for both day/night. I have oily skin that is prone to congestion/acne, so finding one that works with my skin is always a factor. I am on my 3rd tube of the LRP double repair moisturizer and I love it! It's just was I wanted and will be a staple in my routine for now!"
"October 28, 2021",I love it!,"Product is excellent. Creamy, smooth and an excellent moisturizer that is well priced. I seem to like all La-Roche products so far."
"October 26, 2021",La Roche-Posay,"This is a soft, fluid moisturizer that feels great on the skin. They always make great products. No harsh smell."
"October 22, 2021",Double Moisturizer,I’ve been using this product for several years. I use it nightly before applying retinol. It has no fragrance and it is not too heavy. Highly recommend!
"October 13, 2021",Great for skin,This Moisturizer is excellent. Absorbs quickly. Skin is smoother and quenched!!
"October 04, 2021",Absolutely Loving It,"I received my product facial moisturizer and my skin immediately felt so soft and smooth. I have always been a Mary Kay customer, and will definitely be switching over. I can say, I am one happy customer!!!"
"October 03, 2021",Great moisturizer!,I have very sensitive skin and excema on my face. This moisturizer helps calm my skin and hydrate it.
"October 02, 2021",Feels so nice,Very smooth and moisturizing. I’ve purchased this three times. I use it most days but not everyday. Great for when my face feels like it wants a little extra moisture. I can use it day or night.
"September 27, 2021",Amazing daily moisturizer,I have used so many expensive moisturizers in the past and this is by far my favorite. I use Retin A each night which can be drying and this has been so helpful.
"September 26, 2021",Lightweight but moisturizing,Very simple moisturizer that I love. I am repurchasing for the third time.
"September 24, 2021",Great for sensitive and acne prone skin,"My son used this moisturizer while he was on Accutane. As expected, his skin became very dry and peeling while using Accutane. This moisturizer is soothing and effective, absorbs quickly, and little to no scent. There's also a version of this with SPF for daytime use. A great no-nonsense moisturizer that not too light or too heavy."
"September 24, 2021",Great stuff!,Love that this moisturizer has no fragrance or dyes. My skin loves it!
"September 05, 2021",LOVE the way it makes my skin feel,I have been using a different product for several years and tried this on a recommendation from a friend and am so happy that did! Moisturizes without making my face feel greasy.
"September 04, 2021",Great price,The moisturizer is nice. Keeps my skin dewy and moist. Great price for moisturizer.
"August 31, 2021",Great for night time,"This product pills, which doesn't bother me too much at night but makes it not something I reach for in the AM."
"August 23, 2021",I wanted to love this moisturizer,"My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer because I was having some sensitivity problems and she said this one was really mild. I liked the feel of it but after having it on my face for awhile, it didn't sink in but rather stayed on the surface of my skin. When I felt my face, the product kind of ""peeled"" off. Not a fan."
"August 17, 2021",I love it,This was recommended me and I like it.
"August 06, 2021",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,"This moisturizer really works. Nice texture, absorbs quickly, does not have any smell. Lasts for a long time."
"August 03, 2021",Great Value!,"I love this moisturizer! Works well over my facial serums that I use and provides a good base for my sunscreen. Very gentle, no irritation at all and the price is great for all the excellent ingredients!"
"August 01, 2021",My forever go-to,"I’ve been using this lotion for years (and the SPF version in the mornings), and I love it. Not too aggressive, just a nice consistent moisturizer for a great price."
"July 31, 2021",Disappointed overall with how products applied on skin,"I really wanted to love this product as I have heard so many positive things about it but I have not had any success in getting it to apply without the product pilling on my skin. I have attempted application many different ways but each time It does the same thing. I will keep it and maybe try again during wintertime, hopefully, then I will see different results?"
"July 13, 2021",It's an ok moisturizer,"It's a good moisturizer for sensitive skin, just wasn't moisturizing enough for me"
"July 12, 2021",Awesome!,I love this moisturizer it helps to calm my skin and keep it looking well hydrated.
"July 09, 2021",Great Moisturizer,I love this product! makes your skin feel healthy and helped me with dryness. One of my favorite moisturizers.
"July 07, 2021",Love it!,"I'm becoming a big fan of La Roche-Posay products. I use this and the La Roche-Posay gentle cleanser and my skin looks amazing and feels fantastic. I have dry to dry/combination skin and live in a humid climate. This doesn't make my skin feel tacky or oily, it's just the right amount of hydration without being too heavy. Perfect."
"July 03, 2021","Great product, but a tad too much if you're oily/combo","I continue to buy this moisturizer as I believe it's a good product; however, I have recently determined that I have either combo or oily skin (especially in the summer) and this level of moisturizer leave me feeling greasy. This product is likely best for those with dry skin, which is why I keep my rating as 5 stars (because I know this and continue to buy it anyways). I'll likely save it for when temperatures drop, and it makes more sense to use it more frequently."
"June 19, 2021",Feels good,It feels good on my face but I am still having lots of dryness?
"June 14, 2021",Love the moisture of my face.,"It is the last cream in my morning, it adds the moisture my dry face needs. I only wish it had a sun spn. That would make it even better."
"June 11, 2021",So moisturizing!,So I have been using this moisturizer for a few wks. It definitely makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth. No dry flakey spots anymore!
"June 10, 2021",Good PM Moisturizing Lotion,"I have mature, sensitive and oily skin and needed a night lotion that wasn't too heavy or too light or too expensive. This lotion is a tad thick but it hasn't made my skin break out and I love that it's oil-free. Overall, I'm happy with this product and works great at night."
"June 07, 2021","Good for sensitive and dry skin, but pills","This is a great facial moisturizer for sensitive, dry skin. I am sensitive to many ingredients and prefer simple, clean formulas that are hydrating without aggravating my occasional acne or dermatitis and work well with retinol and serums. I used this for 3 weeks to see how it faired against my preferred products. It keeps my dry skin hydrated for the entire day, despite air conditioning and fans, and hasn't caused acne. The only reason I might not repurchase is that I have to apply 2-3 layers, and it pills even after waiting 3-5 minutes between applications. It sits nicely under sunscreen and makeup, though, and I can apply a few drops of water to blend in any pilling. The other reason it's not my favorite is that I can feel it sitting on top of my skin, which I've noticed is more common with some less expensive products. So, it's great because it doesn't cause acne or irritation, but it's not the most amazing moisturizer because it pills if you apply more than one layer."
"June 04, 2021",Silky smooth,Love this product. Feels so soft once applied. Doesn’t feel sticky or heavy. I have rosacea and my skin has not reacted using this moisturizer.
"June 03, 2021",Excellent moisturizer!,"I love this moisturizer. It works great on my sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. Not too heavy in the summer months and just right in the winter. My go to moisturizer."
"June 03, 2021",Fantastic for Sensitive Skin,I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer agrees with me and does the trick! My only gripe is it tends to pill/ball up on my face after application.
"June 01, 2021",Love this lotion,Goes on easy and light. Very gentle on my sensitive skin.
"May 31, 2021",My husband’s fav,He uses this product after I introduced it to him about few years ago.
"May 26, 2021",Just ordered 2 after trying...,"I love this LaRoche Posay moisturizer because my hyper-sensitive skin is not irritated by it at all. Which seems like a miracle. Bought a tube while away from home and am ordered several more today from lovelyskin.com. I've had eczema and cheilitis and so am quite cautious--glad to find this one works for me. Also ordered some Toleriane with sunscreen here recently and am hopeful, so far. Will review that later!"
"May 22, 2021",Feels like silk,First time using this... I love it... think I will order another 1 so I'm stocked up... Loving it!
"May 21, 2021",Effective,It works. My skin is sooo soft and moisturized. I'm glad I found it. Now is my staple.
"May 14, 2021",Great go to moisturizer,"I love that this moisturizer is oil-free and good for sensitive skin. It is light, affordable, and comes in a generous size. Great for my post-Accutane skin routine."
"May 11, 2021",Go to day & night moisturizer,"I use this moisturizer day & night. It is lightweight, but gets the job done unlike some other lightweight moisturizers that just don't hydrate enough. I like how it absorbs in well and is also not oily. It has become my go to."
"May 09, 2021",Excellent moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer! It's fragrance-free and gentle, and I love that it contains ceramides and niacinamide. It's light yet provides enough moisture alongside my nighttime retinoid. The price point is also fantastic."
"May 03, 2021",Pleasant surprise,"I tried this product based on the ingredients - I love niacinamidr - and the absence of parabens. What a pleasant surprise! It is like giving your skin a drink of water that lasts!! The price is almost unbelievable for such a quality product. This is my new moisturizer for daytime after serums. I am buying it for my 27 year old daughter, too, who does not like heavy or greasy moisturizers. Perfect."
"April 27, 2021",Feels amazing,"I love this moisturizer. It makes my face so smooth and it doesn’t burn at all, even when my skin is irritated from Retin-A."
"April 25, 2021",I loved the ceramides,For people with dry skin it works very well. smo the glow that leaves on my face
"April 22, 2021",Every day use,Good for every day use. Not greasy. Soaks right in. No smell. A good go to light moisturizer.
"April 22, 2021",Great moisturizer,"I was hesitant to buy this product because I only use Obagi however, love this moisturizer. Will buy it again."
"April 19, 2021",Thick,Recommended by derm to use on top of retinoid. Daughter seem to like it. Will buy again.
"April 19, 2021",Eh,"This creams pills easily, either alone or with serums. It feels like it sits on skin without fully absorbing. I like this brand but I probably will not buy it again."
"April 17, 2021",Great product,"I have been using this for a couple of months, both day and night. I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer works very well."
"April 12, 2021",Sensitive Skin Must Have!,"This is a great, no irritation causing moisturizer. It feels light on the skin but provides decent moisture, even during a mid-West winter. I like a more emollient moisturizer at night, so I keep this as my third step for day use. I also appreciate that there is NO scent or masking scents added!!"
"April 11, 2021",Awesome basic moisturizer,This is a wonderful basic moisturizer that absorbs quickly and keeps my face hydrated all day.
"April 11, 2021",Live it!!,"It’s my go to moisturizer, I have combination skin and this works perfect for me."
"April 10, 2021",Wonderful soothing product,I bought this in my quest to help my new rosacea. I am very pleased with this cream. A small amount soothes and calms my skin. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a gentle cream for sensitive skin.
"April 10, 2021",Love it,Lightweight and provides good moisture. Love it.
"April 10, 2021",La Rocha-PosayToleriane Moisturizer,Love this moisturizer! It’s non-greasy and leaves my face feeling hydrated. One of the best moisturizer I used. It was one of the 4 products my dermatologist recommended for me to use and I like the La Roche the best.
"April 08, 2021","Super simple, good value","This works for me in the summer time or when I need a simple, light texture. I keep it around because it gets the job done and is inexpensive."
"March 30, 2021",Nice product,"The moisturizer has a nice consistency with minimal scent which I prefer. I use this at night, so far so good. I like the lotion and would order again."
"March 28, 2021",Wonderful,Use this as a blend with retain A cream
"March 06, 2021",Amazing,"Toleriane double repair moisturizer it’s amazing product for my type of oily and sensitive skin before I find this product everything breaks me out and stinging my skin but with this moisturizer my skin feel fresh, soft and moist I love it, I’m using in my eye area and helps me with my fine lines too what else I want I will still ordering from LovelySkin I always get a discount which is good thing."
"March 04, 2021",Love it,"My skin type is acne-prone sensitive skin, hoping to find a great moisturizer to fix skin barrier. This product has been doing an incredible job keeping my skin moist and I am in love with it! recommend for people who have the same skin type as I do."
"February 24, 2021",Best moisturizer ever,"A light moisturizer, easy to mix with other serums or sunscreen."
"February 22, 2021",Soothing moisture without being heavy,"This is my go-to for most of the year. On really dry winter days I may layer it in with something else, but this handles most of my needs AND doesn't get greasy and disgusting in the God-awful Georgia summer humidity :)"
"February 22, 2021",Great for Night Time,I use this as part of my night time routine. I love that it has ceramides and niacinamide in it. I have acne prone skin and it did not irritate my skin but helped it tremendously. I like that it comes in a fairly big bottle and it lasted my quite a long time.
"February 18, 2021",Use in the a.m. and p.m.,This spreads so nicely alone or with a serum. I could not decided to use it in the morning or evening so I use it both in the a.m. and the p.m. Not too thick for day use and yet moisturizing at night.
"February 13, 2021",New Fav!,"LRP products have been so good to my skin in conjunction with prescription tretinoin. This moisturizer is hydrating, gentle, and a great price."
"February 05, 2021",Great!,"Great moisturizer, it’s very hydrating and not greasy. My new favorite face lotion to use under makeup."
"February 05, 2021",Good moisturizer,I have the sunscreen version of this which I really like and decided to buy this one for night time. Good for the dry winter months.
"February 02, 2021",Great moisturizer,This is my go-to moisturizer. I love that it makes my skin feel good without being too heavy or too lightweight.
"February 01, 2021",Nice Moisturizer for the price,"This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It goes on smooth and easy, face feels moisturized but not not weighed down and greasy. I have it in both the regular and with SPF 30...I use one for days I'll just be inside and don't need the sun protection and the other for when I'll be out and about in my car, short walk, etc.. Love them both equally."
"February 01, 2021",Lightweight and soothing,Sooths irritated or dry skin. Also great to use over retinol products.
"January 28, 2021",LaRoche-Posay moisturizer,Really nice goes on smooth absorbs well. Hydrates aging skin.
"January 28, 2021","Hydrating, lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer!","Overall, it is very lightweight, hydrating, and melts into your skin without feeling oily or greasy. I love to use this moisturizer as my first step before I apply tretinoin during the winter, it really helps create a good barrier and reduce tretinoin dermatitis. For reference, I have combination skin that is on the dry side during the winter due to tretinoin. I recommend others give it a try if they're searching for a nice, everyday moisturizer, especially for the winter months!"
"January 23, 2021",Repaired my sensitive skin,"Unfortunately, I became sensitive to another product I was using. I researched to see which products out there would be good for mature, sensitive, dry skin. This came up for all three. I've been using it for two weeks now, and I love how it has repaired my skin from the other product while leaving my face so soft. I bought the toleriane eye cream and night cream as well and so far, I wouldn't change a thing. Goes on beautifully and is not greasy."
"January 22, 2021",Moisturizer,Good moisturizer if you don’t wear makeup because it peels off .
"January 21, 2021",Good with a Serum,I would give it 4 *s but I prefer their Lipikar Intense Moisturizing Cream (for Body and Face) for my evening moisturizer. Lipikar is a bit too much for daytime use but it leaves my face looking great in the morning when used at night. This Touleriane is good used for daytime since it is more absorbent and offers a better make-up base. My skin is normal to dry.
"January 19, 2021",Finally found a non-irritating moisturizer!,"I have recently been struggling with acne, but living in the Midwest during the wintertime coupled with intense acne-fighting products left my skin SO very dry. I've used countless other beauty staple moisturizers out there, but they were either not heavy enough or too greasy/worsened my acne. This is the first product I've tried that is non-clogging, non-greasy, but super moisturizing! My derm recommended this line in general but specifically this product and I'm so grateful she did. Will definitely be re-purchasing."
"January 19, 2021",Moisturizing!,This works well during the winter months and adds moisture. I use it as a a nighttime moisturizer as it is gentle on my sensitive skin and keeps dryness at bay.
"January 12, 2021",Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,My husband has super sensitive skin. This is perfect for him. He loves it!
"December 31, 2020",This is very hydrating,I would recommend this to dry skin. I have dry acne prone skin and this is perfect for that. I purchased more recently !
"December 31, 2020",Useful moisturizer,I love this moisturizer especially for its active ingredients which are very effective.
"December 29, 2020",Exactly what I was looking for,"I needed a non-greasy, fragrance free moisturizer to keep handy in my work-from-home space (my apartment tends to be dry). After reading a bunch of reviews here and elsewhere, I decided to give this a try since it's a brand I already use and trust. It does the trick and at a great price!"
"December 29, 2020",Everyday go to moisturizer,This product really penetrate. Not greasy at all. Great for use under makeup. Feels like it is working on your skin continuously. Has many great benefits.
"December 28, 2020",Effective Light Moisturizer,"I use this in the morning when my skin requires less moisture. While I'm not as impressed as with some other products from this brand, I plan to repurchase as it provides good value for the price."
"December 25, 2020",Perfect everyday moisturizer.,"This moisturizer is great to have around. I have combo skin that is break out prone and never have an issue using this moisturizer. It's great for layering with other products or use on it's own. It has no fragrance. I do opt for something a little more hydrating for dry winter months, but still go back to this in more mild weather."
"December 22, 2020",Love this product!,"I am a huge LRP fan, using their SPFs and well as cleansers and moisturizers. I have mature dry skin and the Toleraine line is exceptional. Great prices here, too."
"November 28, 2020",OK moisturizer,Although it went on smooth it didn't really moisturize my face very well and it left white streaks on my face.
"November 28, 2020",New my moisturizers for night time.,This is perfect for the coming dry season. It is non-greasy and moisturizes overnight. Of course there is no scent.
"November 18, 2020",La Roche-Posay Toleraine Double Repair Moisturizer,"I am 60 years old and am very satisfied with LaRoche Posay Toleraine double repair moisturizer. I use it over their hyaluronic acid serum and it is just right on my skin, not too greasy, not too dry. My wrinkles are softer without being plumped up with formaldehyde as dept. store products will do to your skin."
"November 09, 2020",Great product,Excellent for all day moisture without looking greasy. Feels great.
"November 05, 2020",Unfortunately,I love this line but it peels on my face and try on my body its the same way!
"November 04, 2020",Great hydration,"At the recommendation of my dermatologist, I tried this moisturizer as a replacement for a much more expensive product. After a month of use, I am very happy with the amount of hydration it provides. Feels great under makeup."
"October 31, 2020",Excellent Moisturizer!,"I use this Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer during the day. It is a wonderful moisturizer and keeps the moisture in my skin all day. At night, I use the La Roche-Posay Redermic C which helps with fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkles. My skin is super sensitive, so if I need something for an eczema or rosacea flare up, I switch to the Toleriane Ultra Face Moisturizer for a day or two. My skin has never looked better, thanks all to La Roche-Posay."
"October 17, 2020",Great moisturizer for the price,I use twice a day after cleansing and keeps my face from drying out. Not greasy and leaves my face feeling fresh.
"October 16, 2020",My go to moisturizer,I love this moisturizer. I even took it to my aesthetician to make sure she thought it was good for me and she gave me the thumbs up. It’s a great product at an inexpensive price.
"October 03, 2020",It's ok,Wasn't as moisturizing as I had hoped for. Makeup doesn't go on smoothly. Probably will just use at night.
"October 03, 2020",Great Moisturizer,My teenage daughters use this over their prescription retinol. It is effective at keeping their skin from drying out.
"September 27, 2020",Love this!,"At first I was hesitating to buy this because I prefer gel type moisturizers (combo skin here) but this one shut my mouth. I apply it on damp skin at night cause I think it´s a bit too moisturizing to use at day, and it sinks instantly leaving my face smooth and hydrated and I wake up the next day looking not shiny at all as I used to."
"September 18, 2020",Best I've ever tried!,"Recommended by my dermatologist. It is very moisturizing without being greasy (which is important because I am an athlete). I have seen other reviewers saying it pills- and it will ONLY do that if you apply way TOO much product. And a little goes a long way so there actually is no reason to overapply in the first place. Also, added bonus is it has already made fine lines go away. Overall my skin is in better condition than it has ever been using this product. Highly recommend."
"September 17, 2020",Basic Face Lotion,"I was a little disappointed in this moisturizer, considering the La Roche Posay Toleraine line is one of my favorites for sensitive skin. It doesn't break me out, but it doesn't soak into my skin very well and pills up under makeup."
"September 12, 2020",Great moisturizer,"I use retinol and this keeps me moisturized while soothing my redness, I love it."
"August 29, 2020",My favorite,I use it day and night and I love it. It leaves my skin fresh and it's nor greasy or matte. Just perfect for my combination skin!
"August 27, 2020",Made my face red and sensitive,"I stopped using this moisturizer after one week because my face became red and sensitive. I am not sure which ingredient(s) caused sensitivity (My skin was fine with other niacinamide cream such as Cerave). Also, I think it is not moisturizing enough for normal skin."
"August 13, 2020",doctor's recommendation,worked very well for my skin
"August 07, 2020",Nice product,"I am new to this line of products. I've been using the cleanser and day moisturizer along with the Toleriane Double Repair moisturizer at night. This product is thicker than the day moisturizer which is nice. It disappears into my skin quickly. I break-out easily, especially when I introduce a new product. But I have not had any difficulties with this, or any of the La Roche-Posay Toleriane products I've been using. I would recommend for those of us on a budget."
"August 05, 2020",Another great product,I’ve been trying various products from La-Roche and I really like this moisturizer. It’s no greasy and so far hasn’t caused any breakouts. Been using a few weeks at bedtime and will continue to use it. So happy.
"August 02, 2020",Double Repair Face Moisturizer,"This is a pretty thick cream, I've been alternating this with La Roche-Posay Ultra Night Cream to help with dryness due to retinol products, and it does an amazing job."
"August 01, 2020",powerful ingredients,"I love the formula and the feel of this moisturizer, and a big fan of LRP. By itself, it feels great on the skin and works well for my dry skin in warmer months. I don't like that this is temperamental about layering - it pills pretty easily over serums."
"July 31, 2020",Love!,This moisturizer! So hydrating but no clogs... makes my skin supple and radiant.
"July 24, 2020",Great for sensitive skin!,I have been looking for a moisturizer that doesn’t make me break out. I have tried several - from the drug store brands to the expensive ones- so far this has been the best for me!
"July 21, 2020",Holy Grail Moisturizer,"I started using this product for acne-prone skin about 8 months ago. I very quickly noticed an improvement in my skin’s texture, and other products seemed to layer easily over it (no pilling.) I started accutane and assumed I’d need a much heavier cream to combat dryness and flaking, but to my delight this moisturizer has kept my skin hydrated and happy. I’m so happy to have found an everyday moisturizer that works so well at such a great price point."
"July 21, 2020",Really good face lotion,I’ve tried a lot of face lotions but this is by far one of my favorites. It soaks in well keeping skin hydrated. It doesn’t leave your face greasy. It keeps it fresh and I can wear it under make up if I want. No fragrance. I showed it to my boyfriend and my sister and they both love it so much we’ve all reordered the product several times. Would recommend to anyone.
"July 18, 2020",A Great Basic Moisturizer,"I was searching for a better daily moisturizer and found this one. I saw from other reviews that it was pretty gentle, and I thought the price was great as well. I've been using it for about two weeks now and I'm liking it so far. I have combination/oily skin, and even when layered with a sunscreen, my face doesn't look super shiny or oily and feels very moisturized for how light it goes on. It doesn't have a smell which is also a nice change from how other La Roche-Posay items tend to have a stronger smell to them."
"July 15, 2020",Buena crema,"Very very good cream. Keeps my face hydrated all day, leaves it soft. I love this brand La Roche-Possay. And with this store everything is great, I will keep buying."
"July 10, 2020",Not bad,I bought 2 tubes to try just becuz of the simple good ingredient. It spreads nicely on face. Don't mind to repurchase.
"June 25, 2020",Love this affordable moisturizer,"I have fallen in love with this brand!!! This cream is non greasy, doesn’t clog pores, and moisturizes with no issues. This absolutely this face cream and their body cream. Also the t is super affordable and won’t break the bank!! Seriously, buy it, you won’t regret it! Thank you Lovely Skin!!"
"June 22, 2020",Excellent product for sensitive skin,"I am so impressed with this product. It took all my redness away and made my skin very smooth. I would appreciate if it had SPF, that's the only downside."
"June 12, 2020",Great product,Great moisturizer at an affordable price. I was recommended this from my dermatologist after treating hormonal acne. Love the ingredient list and how it has no fragrance.
"June 09, 2020",Nice-Light Cream,This is a nice light cream. Seem to penetrate quickly. Helps calm redness and leaves skin feeling lightly hydrated. If you apply too much of this cream it will pill. I have only used it at night and I limit how much I use. Just a small dime size or less will do :)
"June 05, 2020",ok,"I have very dry skin this is good under my sunscreen as both together provide good hydration. However alone its just alright, I actually meant to buy the sunscreen instead as I prefer to use that after my vitamin c serum. will be sure I have the correct item in my cart. This is good if you have normal to oily skin. Dry complexions need a lot more."
"May 29, 2020",The perfect everyday moisturizer,"I swear by La Roche-Posay products, this is no exception. It’s nourishing, but not heavy or oily. On top of it all, it’s a great value! Good sized bottle for a great price."
"May 22, 2020",Smooth skin,This face lotion made my skin very soft
"May 21, 2020",Nice Face Cream,"Work well on my dry, sensitive skin without irritation"
"May 19, 2020",Good face cream,Got this for my husband. He likes it. I just love everything from this line.
"April 27, 2020",Great moisturizer,This is my 3rd time ordering this product. I love the way it feels and moisturizes my skin. I also appreciate the little to no fragrance.
"April 17, 2020",Great moisturizer,"A simple, no fragrance, very good moisturizer to be used with my morning routine products, such as vitamin C underneath and colored sunscreen on top of it. Light moisture, dries fast on skin."
"March 22, 2020",perfect,Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer is light enough to absorb easily and leaves my skin moisturized all day. It does last 24 hours. Non greasy. Goes well under sunblocker and make up. I will buy it again because it hasn't caused my skin to break out and it may even dissipate some of the redness. I think it's an all seasons type of moisturizer. Faithful LaRoche Posay user.
"February 16, 2020",moisturized,"Trying this for the first time, this moisturizer applies well on my face. It feels good on application and is light. I do need to apply a bit more on days when it' really windy/cold. Good value."
"February 15, 2020",Pills on my face,"I had high hopes for this moisturizer because I use several LRP products, and it has a good EWG rating. I have dry skin. Similar to some other reviewers I found that it pills on my face (I had the same experience with Toleriane Double Repair with SPF), but makes a good hand moisturizer. I'm sure it is a great choice for many, just not for me."
"February 13, 2020",Love this stuff!,Have tried several moisturizers and always end up going back to this stuff.
"February 07, 2020",Amazing!,This moisturizer makes my face feel amazing. Really soft and I love the smell
"January 08, 2020",Wonderful face moisturizer.,"I bought the La Roche-Posay moisturizer with high hopes as I have been searching for a non toxic face moisturizer. This was a great find. I am 53 and beginning to show signs of age. It contains ceramides which I was looking for, and niacinamide also. A great product that works to moisturize dry skin and great for sensitive skin which I have and no breakouts or problems. Love this, will re purchase!!"
"December 24, 2019",For Sensitive skin?,"Very disappointed with a LRP Toleraine product since the Toleraine line is geared for sensitive skin. The description says ""soothes red, irritated complexion...perfect for sensitive skin.” Then, why does it sting when I apply it? This makes no sense. There is some ingredient in this that doesn't fit the bill. LRP needs to reformulate this one. I loved the now discontinued Toleraine Riche Soothing Protective Cream, which was rich and soothing without irritation—so far there is no acceptable substitute."
"December 12, 2019",Lotion for sensitive skin,"Not sure how I feel about this lotion. I have very sensitive acne prone skin. Every time I’ve used this lotion, it had caused my skin to have a but omg sensation, so I’m not inclined to use it as often as I had hoped."
"December 03, 2019",Great moisturizer,"Light, effective, and without unwanted scents."
"December 01, 2019",Great!,Perfectly made for super dry skin.
"November 29, 2019",Moisturizer,"I bought this for my daily moisturizer it does an OK job, but my skin still need something more to keep it from getting dry."
"November 27, 2019",Nice Thick Moisturizer for Winter,Really nice and thick. But doesn't clog pores. No weird scent either. Great for Winter. Very happy with it.
"November 24, 2019",The Perfect Moisturizer!,"I have sensitive, combination skin that also has acne and rosacea. I was using the Sensitive Fluid and switched to this for winter because I needed more moisture. This is the perfect oil free solution for sensitive skin that's oily or combo—it's not super rich so you don't feel weighed down, but not so light you get residual dry flakes. I also love the tube packaging so that you can snip open the top and dig out any extra. I'm a customer for life!"
"November 22, 2019",It has really helped my skin look healthier and less oily,"I only apply this moisturizer at night, but I love it! My skin has really improved since using the product. I've been using it 2 years. My dermatologist recommended it to help reduce the excesses shine on my face. My skin feels so good, and I've noticed less shine on my face throughout the day. I also have very sensitive skin and I have not had any kind of allergic reaction from applying it on my face."
"November 21, 2019",GREAT MOISTURIZER!,I love this product! This moisturizer is very light and not greasy. It works very well for us who suffer from acne. I wear it every day and every night! Works wonders for my skin.
"November 19, 2019",Amazingly effective,"For a simple moisturizer that provides the skin nutrients and protects the barrier, this is THE product. I have sensitive, dry skin and live in a dry climate that rarely gets over 20% humidity outside. This stuff makes my skin feel comfortable. I love La Roche-Posay."
"November 16, 2019",Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer. I use it every night after putting on my serum or Retin A prescription. This has some good ingredients in it which are helpful to the face. La Roche products are good, and I love them as they do not irritate my skin, as I have sensitive skin."
"November 05, 2019",Great Moisturizer for dryer months,"I have comb, acne prone skin, and I use this as my daily AM moisturizer in the fall/winter when it gets dry. It addresses my dryer skin without producing excess oil on my T-Zone. When the weather switches to hot and humid, I switch to the Toleriane sensitive fluid. The price is great for the size that you receive."
"October 21, 2019",Really like this!,This is my second time purchasing this product and will definitely buy again. It has calmed the redness on my face so much and has not aggravated my skin. It sinks in super fast yet leaves my face moisturized for hours. I recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin who wants a simple moisturizer that works.
"October 14, 2019",Love it!,"I have used many facial moisturizers, and this is my favorite! Will buy again."
"September 23, 2019",Light and scent-free,"This moisturizer is fresh and scentless. Somehow, it keeps me from getting dry throughout the day without sitting on top of my skin like a barrier. It disappears into my skin and feels weightless. My husband loves it; he even uses it more than I do!"
"August 15, 2019",Hydrating,"The creamy rich texture feels so good on my skin. I usually used it during winter and also, during summer at night or on top of my Retin-A. It doesn’t feel greasy and my face looks hydrated on the following day. Because of it’s consistency, you won’t need to apply a lot that makes it lasts for months. With LovelySkin’s free shipping, you’ll save a couple bucks more."
"August 03, 2019",Perfect,I love this moisturizer is not greasy and it doesn't leave any residue. The ingredients are great to protect and repair the skin barrier.
"July 31, 2019",Great product,Great product helps with dry skin is not oily at all I loved it
"July 08, 2019",Wonderful,"Another great product from Lovelyskin.com. I was using the EltaMD line, which I loved, but was looking for something that would do the trick of moisturizing without exacerbating by rosacea or acne, but was a bit more affordable for our family. Light moisture great for day and night. Part of my regular routine now."
"June 26, 2019",Simply good at what it does,"I wanted to try a simple moisturizer with ceramides without breaking the bank. My skin is somewhat dry and sensitive from starting tretinoin, so I wanted something moist and comforting with no fragrance (or even naturally-occurring scents). This works well for me. It spreads easily without being slippery, and it absorbs without a residue. It feels natural on my skin (I don't even feel it). A little goes a long way, so I use a very small amount before applying sunscreen in the morning. At night, I use a pea-size dab to cover my face I layer something heavier over it over my flaking areas. I've had no eye irritation from this. The tube will last me a long time, even though I use it twice a day. It's well worth the price."
"June 15, 2019",Fantastic Skincare,This is a fantastic moisturizer. Has wonderful ingredients. Leaves my skin soft and not at all irritated.
"June 01, 2019",Love the creamy texture!,"I use this moisturizer in the evening for deep hydration. I absolutely love the creamy feel of it and it leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and silky smooth, yet it isn’t greasy."
"May 21, 2019",Great Moisturizer,This moisturizer was recommended by a dermatologist to me and has been the only one to moisturize my face and not cause breakouts. This product is affordable and goes a lasts a while even with twice daily use.
"May 20, 2019",Do Not Like The Smell,I did not like the scent of this product and quit using it.
"April 15, 2019",Great Moisturizer!,"Great moisturizer, especially during the winter to prevent dry skin. Now that it is warming up, I don't want to look ""greasy"". I use a pea size amount for my entire face. I have adult acne and combination skin. This moisturizer does not make my acne worse."
"April 11, 2019",Good moisturizer,Absorbs nicely. Perfect hydration for my combination skin. Great for day and night. And a good price too. Love it!
"April 09, 2019",Works well for hands,"This is a nice lotion, however I have found it works better for hand use than on my face. It seems to pill/ball up on my face even with a small amount, and it feels as though there is an unbreathable silicone layer on my face for which I don't care. However, I have found it works well on my red rough patches on my hands from using too much alcohol rub at work!"
"April 02, 2019",Love it!,I really love this product in the winter when my face needs a little more moisture. The best part is that it's not greasy or too heavy. I'll definitely buy again!
"March 14, 2019",light and smooth application,"I have aging and dry skin, but this product seems to go on really smooth, and helps hydrate me. Great price. I have been using Epionce and decided to try this because it's less expensive. I will probably buy again."
"March 05, 2019",love it!,"I've been using for about 6 months, and I love it. I wish the applicator was easier to use when you get down to the end of the bottle, but besides that, it's been great."
"March 03, 2019",Favorite light cream,This is one of my go-to creams. I can use it alone when I need a light cream or as a base cream when using a sunscreen or other. Love it.
"March 01, 2019",Hydrating yet light,"This facial moisturizer feels super hydrating. I love that it had the ceramides in it to protect your skin's barrier. It also doesn't feel heavy or thick, goes in smooth and leaves your skin soft. I really like it!"
"February 06, 2019",Love this stuff!,"Worked great for my dry, sensitive skin. Left my face feeling moisturized, supple and oil-free. Love this stuff!"
"January 27, 2019",Excellent Moisturizer,"My dermatologist suggested this cream for my daughter who is a competitive swimmer. Being in the pool with all that chlorine dries her skin out terribly. Since using this cream, her skin is no longer dry and irritated but soft and hydrated. Great product will continue to purchase."
"January 24, 2019",Excellent cream,I was looking for a moisturizer for my winter skin which is dry & sensitive. I explored several option & chose this one. So glad I did. My facial skin feels so soft & supple after this cream goes on. I love it. So glad I can trust LRP to provide quality products at reasonable pricing. That's also to LovelySkin.com for great service.
"January 17, 2019","Soothing. Great for Sensitive skin and ACNE, really WORKS! AFFORDABLE !","Oh my gosh, I just love the feel of this stuff; whether your oily, combo or dry, it feels awesome. The consistency is thick but really soaks in the skin. I do not breakout with this product and am prone to cystic acne (37 years old), but this moisturizer helps heal scars, soothe skin and keep skin comfortable. My whole family is now using it, including sons and daughters of various skin concerns and all love it! Highly recommend. Great price, product lasts quite awhile too. The sunscreen version is also amazing! Gives a nice healthy sheen to skin."
"January 03, 2019",Excellent Product,No adverse reactions and my skin feels moisturized after using.
"December 26, 2018",Light and moisturizing,This lotion feels light on the skin and keeps skin moisturized without feeling greasy. It absorbs quickly and skin stays soft and hydrated.
"December 08, 2018",Face repair moisturizee,Received a sample of this moisturizer and right away I feel in love. My skin is super dry in some areas. This product provided moisture to my skin and reduced appearance wrinkles. Small amount goes a long way.
"October 03, 2018",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer,Really like this moisturizer and feels good on skin.
"August 02, 2018",Amazing,This moisturizer has saved my super sensitive skin. Everything always burns my skin but not this. It also balances out the oil and keeps me hydrated.
"August 01, 2018",I think that this is a huge hit for La Roche-Posay!,"It is effective at preventing dryness all day. It skins in quickly and doesn't leave residue to interact with sunscreen or makeup, and it does seem to promote a healthy skin barrier. I have noticed less sensitivity and redness in my skin when using this moisturizer. I also love that price per oz. Over all: it''s a solid not-so-basic moisturizer that appears to promote skin health."
"July 19, 2018","""Repair"" is the fame of this name","I have been using this moisturizer for the last 8 months now. I am at the end of my third bottle and am very pleased with it! My goal with skincare is clear skin, not trying products for fun or looking for the next best thing. I like consistency and function. I introduced this moisturizer when I had a very poor skincare routine consisting of far too much chemical exfoliation, a hydration serum heavy on the penetration enhancers, no moisturizer, and no SPF. My skin was inflamed, sore, and acne-ridden. I started using this in the evenings along with the UV Double Repair by day, and within a few days my skin soreness was gone and acne started to heal. Within several weeks, my skin was clear and has been for the last 8 months. This is likely because these moisturizers provide nourishment and don''t contain many common-known irritants. This cream is rather watery gel/lotion like and does have an extremely mild, micro-fine ""grit"" to it. It can pill a bit sometimes, however, when I applied this with a hydrating serum, I don''t have that problem. This is also very skin softening. I wake up daily, even after all these months of use, with soft, calm, and very bright looking skin. I use this with a basic hydrating HA and panthenol serum after cleansing with the Toleriane Gentle Hydrating Cleanser. Very simple. I recommended this to a few friends who in turn started using, all with acne and all with great, similar results. This is a very well done product and I hope to always have this available to purchase along with the SPF!"
"June 30, 2018",Like the feel of the lotion,"Not sure how I feel about this for my face. After using a few nights, I had a little breakout–not sure if it was this product. The bottle does not feel full, but I always cut open my tubes. You'd be surprised how much is left, at least 4-5 days. Don't want to waste a drop!"
"June 19, 2018",Excellent on Sensitive Skin,"I have Rosacea and Hormonal Acne that has been very difficult to treat. Many other brands cause more redness and increases your acne. I started using La Roche-Posay Double Repair Toleriane, and my skin has actually cleared up. My scarring is finally starting to fade from all the old acne scars. I cant live without this product, and I am so happy that LovelySkin.com frequently offers this product on sale with free shipping and handling!!"
"June 01, 2018",Great product and value!,"I was looking for an effective moisturizer that would work well for my slight case of rosacea and chose this brand for their ingredients and based on other reviews. I couldn’t be happier with the results. A small amount is very hydrating and soothing. I use it in the morning and at night (works well under makeup). I’ve ordered twice so far and with the price discount plus free shipping, this is the best value I have seen anywhere. Great product. Highly recommend!"
"May 16, 2018",The very best moisturizer,"I have ordered this cream a couple of times, and I just love it! I am in my 50s, and I have dry skin (due to age and retinol products). This cream is so moisturizing. I use it under my makeup and after my anti-aging products at night. I was using another brand from the drugstore, but it had a lot of bad ingredients. So I decided to give this a try, and I am glad I did. I will keep repurchasing this cream."
"May 16, 2018",Very Happy! Clear Smooth Face!,I purchased to replace an expensive moisturizer brand and was extremely happy overall. It smooths on nicely and keeps my complexion clear and soft. I will repurchase once I use it all up.
"May 14, 2018",Great oil-free moisturizer,"I use this at night as well as under my make up on dry days. Dries matte, has no weird smell. It can peel if you use too much, so you only need a little bit–which goes a long way."
"April 06, 2018",Great Moisturizer!,Love this face cream! Very effective with taking care of my dry skin this winter. Lasts all day. Been using it for almost a month now and got quick results.
"March 31, 2018",Great Moisturizer,I love this moisturizer. I'm on my second tube. I don't break out or turn red and it helps to keep skin hydrated.
"March 17, 2018",Good for sensitive skin,"I received this as a sample, and I like it. I use Retin-A, have sensitive skin, and get dry patches. This moisturizer is very soothing. My dry patches are gone after one week, and I love that it's unscented. I will purchase it again when my sample runs out."
"March 09, 2018",La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double,Like the moisturizer very much. Don't care for the packaging. It is difficult to squeeze the moisturizer out with its shape and style.
"February 23, 2018",Average Moisturizer,Nothing special about it. I have very dry skin and it was not enough moisture for me to use it without another cream.
"February 06, 2018",Ok moisturizer,"I like this moisturizer, but it's not enough for me and my dry skin in the winter. I think this will be a great moisturizer for me in the summer"
"January 30, 2018",Pretty nice,It can kinda pill on your Face If you use too much but overall it’s very nice
"January 29, 2018",Great moisturizer,"I like this moisturizer because it’s in a tube and you can’t bacteria in it. Also, it doesn’t have any smell. It isn’t heavy and has no sunscreen and can be used day and night."
"January 25, 2018",Age over 50,"I have tried moisturizers from Olay to La Mer and in-between. This is a very good moisturizer and has the convenience of a tube. Great for travel. I like using this before I put on my makeup because it sinks in well. For an evening moisturizer, I still prefer something slightly heavier."
"January 16, 2018",Great for my teenager,"My teenager has dry, acne prone skin and this moisturizer works great. This moisturizer doesn't clog pores and it helps protect skin from dryness that is a side effect caused from a dermatologist prescribed cream. This is especially helpful during these winter months. However, my other teenager has oily, acne prone skin and uses the same prescription that drys out the skin. This teenager tried the Double Repair as well but had to stop because it made the skin too oily. This teenager is now trying the La Roche-Posay Effaclar MAT Oil-Free Mattifying Moisturizer."
"December 13, 2017",La roche-posay,"Lovely moisturizer. No moisturizer is ever moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I tried kiehls, first aid, & many many others. Of course, la roche-posay works as all of their products are amazing. This moisturizer is thinner, very supple, blends into the skin to create a real feeling of moisture. Ahh :)"
"November 16, 2017",Summer favorite,"Quality ingredients and affordable. Love this as my summer moisturizer. I have this as well in the UV formulation. I need an oil free product during the warmer months, and this product does the job!"
"November 01, 2017",Outstanding Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer. Our entire family from teens to husband are now using it. It hydrates, soothes, calms skin. Our teens have oily skin, and this product doesn’t clog pores. My husband and I have mature skin, and it hydrates us while being light and clean feeling. I have tried more products than you could imagine, and this one is the one for me. Wish I knew about it years ago! Glad I am able to get my teens on it early in life."
"October 14, 2017",Guest,I'm staying with La-Roche products!
"September 27, 2017",Great product!!!,This cream is perfect for my skin.
"August 18, 2017",Pretty Good Moisturizer,"I've really come to love the La Roche-Posay line and this moisturizer is on par with their other products I've used. It isn't quite as heavy as I would like at night, but does a good job for daytime. Doesn't smell weird, soaks in quickly and hasn't caused breakouts."
"July 26, 2017",Great Price Point!,I purchased this because I was having pretty dry patches of skin and wanted an inexpensive moisturizer with Niacinamide. I love it! I use this before my morning runs with SPF. It has helped with my dry skin!!!
"July 24, 2017",Good moisturizer,Light but yet skin feels firm. Like that there is no fragrance.
"July 11, 2017",Awesome!!!,It is a great moisturizer!! Won't clog your pores and makes skin feel and look great!!
"June 23, 2017",Worth it!,Great product! Bought this moisturizer because my dermatologost recommended it and I've been using it for about a month now and my skin is looking much better and less breakouts and also thank you LovelySkin for going out of your way to make your customers happy!!!
"June 06, 2017",nice texture,"I mistakenly ordered the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer product without sunscreen and decided not to return it when reordering spf product. While this is an ok moisturizer, I probably would not reorder. However, the spf version is great under my make-up and helps a great deal with dryness."
"June 02, 2017",Glad I found this,"Have been using this at night because I use a tinted moisturizer for daytime. I have been using this after a retinol, which is very drying to my skin. So far, I am happy with the feel of the moisturizer, the size and price. I also like the fact that it has no bothersome fragrance."
"April 18, 2017",Love it!,"This moisturizer has helped my skin stay hydrated, very happy with it."
"April 04, 2017",good quality,I used it only for a week. It seems a good moisturizer with very good ingredients. It feels good on your skin. I would say it's good for combination and normal skin and for dry skin maybe in spring/summer (for winter months I think it is not enough for a dry skin)
"March 23, 2017",Good basic moisturizer,This is just a basic moisturizer without fuzz that really hydrates the skin and its light at the same time. I love that it doesn't break me out and leaves a soft matte finish on the skin once it dries down that is good for under make up.
"March 02, 2017",Best Moisturizer in a long time,"Since my skin has aged (I'm mid 40s) I've had trouble finding a moisturizer that worked for me. This one contained a ceramide that I thought would work and it does! It absorbed well into the skin and doesn't feel sticky or heavy. I started using it once a day, worried about break outs and cyst acne on my chin, but when it didn't happen I started twice a day. My skin looks great and no breakouts since I started using it twice a day a month ago."
"February 28, 2017","Silky, Non-Greasy, Quick Absorbing","I am acne prone (cystic) skin and am currently undergoing IPL for sun damage and hyper pigmentation on my face. I don't usually do well with moisturizer due to my acne problems, but needed to find one that I could use during this treatment that was not greasy but still moisturizing. This is a great find, I have not had any additional break out issues and the product goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin silky and soft. The price is very reasonable on LovelySkin.com so I will be using it as my go to from here on out. Highly recommend."
"February 25, 2017",good,"It doesn't make a miracle, but if you will use all the ""Toleriane"" products you will see the difference and get good results))"
"February 21, 2017",For Sensitive skin. Acne prone,"I had other expectations for this moisturizer, but somehow it didn't work for me. It's supposed to be a double repair moisturizer but it still leaves my skin dry.."
"February 13, 2017",gentle,I have really sensitive skin + I sometimes use a Rx retinoid which makes my skin even more sensitive. This product feels gentle and soothing on my skin and leaves a soft finish. I'll definitely buy it again.
