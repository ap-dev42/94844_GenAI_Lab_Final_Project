# 94844_GenAI_Lab_Final_Project

## Introduction:
This project experiments with the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable information from the descriptions of a range of commercially available products, along with their respective customer reviews, to use as input to a diffusion model with the intent of recreating product images. For this experiment, we made use of the LLM gpt-3.5-turbo and the diffusion model DALL-E 3 as made available through the OpenAI API. Our efforts and analysis were conducted with the aim of assessing the generative capabilities of both models, along with their ability to interpret and understand features of importance pertaining to the products.
## Product Selection:
We selected three products for evaluation and analysis, each representing a different market with different target audiences and varying levels of customer reviews.
Product 1: Diabetes Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Product 2: La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer
Product 3: Boxing Gloves
Rationale: 
Product 1: Is a healthcare product that is in high demand due to its ability to assist in the treatment of diabetes. It has numerous defining technical features and customer reviews that concern the productâ€™s uses. This product serves as a good example to test whether generative AI products can identify important technical features and derive accurate visualizations from usage context.
Product 2: Is just one example of a skin moisturizing product that exists within a market that is saturated with similar products and sub-products from different brands. This product serves as a good example for testing the ability of generative AI products to highlight brand specific details and create visualizations that ensure product differentiation.
Product 3: Is an example of a high demand product for a particular sport that values both the functionality and appearance of the boxing gloves. This product serves as a test for whether generative AI products can identify features based on functionality and visual appeal.
