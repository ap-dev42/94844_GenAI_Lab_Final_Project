A pill would be a step backwards since it would be more like the pen which is a manual process.

      "Hey man - welcome to the club nobody wants to join. I highly highly recommend every newly dx’d T1 reads **Think Like a Pancreas** - it’s the diabetic bible and will introduce you to things like basal/bolus, insulin to carb ratios, correction factors, all the facts. I found a lot of success early on in eating low carb, but the truth is you’ll find what works for you and your own body. It really is such a nuanced illness and what works for some doesn’t work for others. Please push for and get a continuous glucose monitoring device (CGM) like asap. Everyone on insulin should have access to a CGM period. Your doctor might have a sample to give you - my first was there Freestyle Libre but I transitioned to the Dexcom G6. You might feel sick as your BG starts to lower. I did. I was averaging like 400+ at dx and it took like a month to really start coming down. Getting used to normal BGs can be a shock to the system at first, but believe me when I say you will be surprised at how much better you feel once you start taking insulin. I thought I was “fine,” and how close I was to hospitalization/death was surprising. This community is very welcoming you’ll find, and there’s a lot of tips and tricks you’ll find. I learned a lot from here, sometimes more so than from my endo and nurses. That lived experience makes a difference. The first year is the hardest. You have to almost relearn everything. I was a week out from my 30th birthday when I got dx’d - first in my family with no history. Holidays, birthdays, exercise, a night out to the bar - it takes sooooo much planning now. Mentally it’s a strain so I encourage you to see a therapist to help you process if you start feeling anxious/depressed. We’re all here with you, so feel free to DM if you wanna chat. Big hug.\n",

The alarms are extremely helpful. I try to avoid highs but don't panic when I have them. It's the longer Time in Range you can achieve that keeps you from getting too many complications. My advice is to use as much of the technology and information out there to help you balance your life. Even after all these years, I'm still learning how to manage things better. A good target is between 130 - 160. Staying low, like 80, will stress you out more than keeping in a more moderate range. Live long and prosper.\n",

      "DME is durable medical equipment, not Medicare. It doesn't matter how they are covered, as DME or regular RX, if Medicare (or Medicaid) paid for any portion of the supplies it is illegal to make money on the sale of items (including walkers, wheelchairs, medical beds, etc). Bottom line though is that it is illegal to sell, or redistribute prescription medical supplies such as insulin. CGM supplies, etc in the US- even if you paid 100% out of pocket for the purchase of the items. Typically companies that take donations will only take blood sugar testing supplies and syringes, as these are available without a prescription in the US. Insulin may be a grey area, as I know you can walk into a pharmacy and purchase regular and NPH insulin but more updated insulin types still require a doctor's prescription. They still won't typically allow donation though as they cannot ensure it was stored safely while in your keeping. Its been a number of years since I changed CGM versions and had supplies to get rid of. I couldn't find a valid charity to donate to, nor a legitimate place to sell the supplies, though a number of resale companies were interested in buying them from me to illegally distribute. I ended up running an online ad and finding someone local who I could donate to. I can't be sure they didn't sell them somewhere illegally, but at least I met them and had hope they would go to good use. It was still illegal for me to give them to her as well, but I couldn't stomach sending them to a landfill when they could improve someone's life! I think its ridiculous that we can't donate unused insulin (I threw out hundreds of dollars of Lantus when I went onto a pump- I couldn't even donate to foreign hurricane survivors at that time), CGM supplies, or other items that could be so helpful for others!!! There should be a company that can help evaluate the safety of product and put them to use where needed, but there isn't and the prescription laws make it unlikely there ever will be.\n",

      "So I asked here which cgm should I get and the majority said that dexcom is the best but I unfortunately found out that it’s not available in my country (egypt) so I was like alright libre 2 it is then but then I found out only libre 1 is available in egypt , so is it worth it or not? Will it help me bring my a1c down cause that’s really the purpose of buying it , I’m afraid it will give false readings which may even harm me more so what do you think?\n",

      "I was diagnosed in 1994. I was never taught about glucagon. I’ve got two pens in my fridge now just in case but I’ve never used them. I’ve come close when my Dexcom read LOW for over a half hour a few days ago, but I had a full can of Dr. Pepper and a whole six pack of peanut butter crackers and an hour later I was staring down 280. I really am sick and tired of this rollercoaster. I was heading to bed tonight, apparently I took too much insulin with the two slices of pizza I had for dinner and I was at 92 double dropping straight down. So I had to take my CPAP mask off, stumble out of the bedroom to the fridge and grab a Dr Pepper. I need to restock on glucose tabs. I’ll try to do that at Walgreens tomorrow if I get a break in my workday. Stay in the fight y’all. Good luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think Like a Pnacreas by dr Scheiner is a must have. Get a CGM like dexcom or Libre sooner rather than later. Make sure you have en endocrinologist and they’ll help work out your basal, bolus (I:c ratios), and correction factor. There’s a couple type 1 specific subs as well r/diabetes_T1\n",
      "\n",
      "I just moved from NS to ON and feel the same there/here too. It's terrifying. ERs closing due to short staff, no available doctors anywhere. I'm still waiting to get an endo here after moving, and my husband's insurance won't cover my pump supplies and CGM without an endo's signature\n"
