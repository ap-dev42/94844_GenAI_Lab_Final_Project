Create an image of a sleek, modern skincare product with a minimalist design featuring a white tube or jar labeled "La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer." The label should prominently display key features such as "Strengthens skin's moisture barrier," "Provides up to 48 hours of moisture," and "Calms skin with niacinamide." Include subtle graphics or representations of ceramides and the ingredient niacinamide to highlight their benefits. The overall aesthetic should convey a sense of luxury, effectiveness, and dermatologist-recommended quality in line with the brand's reputation.
